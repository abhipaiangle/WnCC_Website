        Digital Image Perception is a simplified algorithm to have the perception of depth (or distance) based on the two different images taken at same time from different (but related) perspectives. This project is inspired by the perception of depth (or distances) by human visual system.
        <br /><br />
        We have two visual receptors that capture real world image at same instant but from two related but different perspectives. We will use digital image correlation for most part of the project. We will mostly work on Google Colab.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Prerequisites:</b>
        <br />
        Knowledge of functioning of a camera, how its sensor works, how images are produced and some basic knowledge of linear algebra, and should be comfortable with python language.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Proposals:</b>
        <br />
        A two page proposal is mandatory in pdf form (other formats will not be entertained) which should include following points:
        <br />
        1. Your motivation for this project
        <br />
        2. Functioning of cameras (uses of lens, shutter, and other basic equipment present in the camera, terms like focal length, aperture, etc.)
        <br />
        3. If you are given a 1000x1000 matrix A and a 4x4 matrix B, how will you find where B lies in A (write your approach and think of the scenarios where your approach may fail).
        <br />
        4. Make a github profile, get yourself acquainted with its features, make a repo named Digital Depth Perception and share the link.
