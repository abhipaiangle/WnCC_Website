        Implement your own sequence neural net
        <br><br>
        Ever dreamed of making the compression algorithm from Pied Piper featured in the popular Silicon Valley series? Here is your chance! The project aims at implementing a potentially lossless algorithm which, unlike others, can work even on high entropy data. The project will involve basic knowledge of Discrete Time Fourier Transform, signal processing. However, a major portion would involve developing expertise in neural networks with focus on RNNs, LSTMs, etc. You would implement your own sequence to sequence neural net aimed at performing a particular task which is essential to the working of compression algorithm.
