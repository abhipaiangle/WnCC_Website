        Rubik’s cube is one of the most fascinating 3-D combination puzzles we encounter. It is simple to understand the game, given a permutation we need to reduce the cube to a single goal state by rotating it. In this project, we will accomplish solving this cube with as minimum rotations as possible using the ideas of reinforcement learning.
        <br><br>
        <b>There will be three modules that need to be completed.</b>
        <br>
        1. Given the details about the faces of the cube, solve the puzzle in the back-end
        <br>
        2. Given an image, extract the details about the faces of the cube using various image processing and possibly ML techniques
        <br>
        3. Develop an user interface for the above solution
