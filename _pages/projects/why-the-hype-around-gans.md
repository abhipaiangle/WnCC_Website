        Yann LeCun described GANs as “the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in Machine Learning”. And, indeed, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs for short) have had a huge success since they were introduced in 2014 by Ian J. Goodfellow.
        <br><br>
        This project will involve learning many machine learning algorithms leading to GANs. Mentees will implement a Generative Adversarial Network from scratch.
        <br><br>
        For students who have participated in Summer of Science (Machine Learning track) before, this would be a great hands-on project!
