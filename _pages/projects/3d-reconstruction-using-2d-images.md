        Producing 2D images of a 3D world is inherently a lossy process, i.e. the entire geometric richness of 3D gets projected onto a single flat 2D image. We aim to create an API in Python which primarily reconstructs 3D volumes from 2D X-Ray Images.
<br><br>
We see this project as the first step towards a diagnostic tool in conditions where either no CT equipment or the education to interpret x-ray imagery is available, such as for mobile x-ray devices, lay users, or medical diagnostics in developing countries. The project is primarily divided into 2 parts:
<br><br>
    Implementation of various CNN architectures for 3D reconstruction from 2D images(3 people would be working on this part)
<br><br>
    Development of API(back-end framework for the above task).1 mentee would be working on this part.
<br><br>
Part 1 has some hard pre-requisites while anyone who has an interest in python or has done some basic programming in python or java-script can apply for part 2.
<br><br>
Pre-requisites for part 1: Must be familiar with any one of the following deep learning frameworks: Pytorch/Tensorflow/Theano/Keras. A basic idea of neural networks and machine learning is required. Previous experience in image processing is desired although is not a hard pre-requisite.
<br><br>
Interested people in this part should go through the following <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04867.pdf'>paper</a> while applying.
<br><br>
Note: If you are new to deep learning, it is recommended that you should go through the first 5 chapters of the <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33986067-deep-learning-with-python'>book</a> before applying.
