        Implementing mesh neural network for 3D shape representation.
        <br><br>
        The project will be an implementation of the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11424">MeshNet: Mesh Neural Network for 3D Shape Representation (AAAI 2019)</a>. Mesh is an important and powerful type of data for 3D shapes and widely studied in the field of computer vision and computer graphics. A lot of research is going on to improve the accuracy of the 3D model classification. This paper has achieved 91.9% accuracy. You are expected to implement this research paper. The additional work may include modifying the NN Architecture and train the model on additional datasets.
        <br><br>
        The following points must be included in the proposal for the project:
        <br>
        <br>- Your motivation and understanding of the project
        <br>- Background in ML/DL (include your previous projects)
        <br>- Experience with Python and libraries (Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc)
